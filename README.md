# timeservice - app

## Description

This is a TypeScript + NodeJS app that uses Express library to expose a REST API that serves the current time in ISO format, as well as the IP address. This app is Dockerized since it is expected to run in a Kubernetes cluster (under AWS EKS). See `Dockerfile` for more details.

## Request Example

curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/time'

## Output Example

{
"timestamp": "2025-02-04T01:08:24.856Z",
"ip": "10.0.2.233"
}

## About buildx for Docker Builds

`docker buildx` is used (instead of `docker build`) because it allows us to build images for multiple architectures (AMD64 and ARM64). This is important because our EKS nodes might have different CPU types, and we want to make sure the container runs on any of them.

Instead of using docker build and docker push separately, buildx does everything in one command, so itâ€™s faster and avoids issues with architecture compatibility.
